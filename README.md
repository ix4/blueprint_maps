An alternate cartography for google maps based on architectural blueprints.

------------

This was built for fun using documentation from [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/3.exp/reference)

The cartography is stored in blue_print_style.json

It can be pasted into Google Maps API like in index.html

The style works everywhere except South Korea.  Map tiles in South Korea are currently pre-rendered and do not support custom styling.  This issue has been reported [here](https://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=2852)
